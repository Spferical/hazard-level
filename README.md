# Hazard Level

A short horror tactics roguelike game made for 2021 7DRL.

███-████-1 has breached containment in Site 14. The staff that have not evacuated are likely afflicted by ███-████-2, and to make matters worse, this happened while feeding ███-███. At this point, the nuke failsafe should have triggered, but the site's AI ██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ to ███████████. Your mission is to find a working on-site computer and manually trigger the site nuke with the code ██████. After activation, you will have █ minutes to get out of there. The helicopter won't be sticking around, but if you can dive █m into the ocean and stay there, you should survive the initial blast. Good luck.
